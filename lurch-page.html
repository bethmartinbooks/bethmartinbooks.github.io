      <h1>YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED</h1>
      <p>When a machine could do as much work as three men, the labor force was quickly replaced by much more efficient androids. As the number of robots grew, jobs disappeared, and everyone in the middle class found themselves obsolete. While the wealthiest few prosper, most of humanity has been thrown into extreme poverty.</p>

      <h1>No one could have predicted what happened.</h1>
      <p>The wealthiest of the population were able to buy up all the influance along with all the land. Once they had the government out of the way, there was nothing stopping them from creating huge estates staffed by an army of robots.</p>
      <p>Everyone else watched as civilization collapsed. There were no jobs or resources to survive. They must rely on theft for everything they need, even food. But stealing isn't tollerated by the security robots partolling everywhere.</p>
      <p>Surviving is dangerous and not for the weak hearted.</p>
      <p>With such unrest, it was inevitable that someone would take matters into their own hands. The lurch have started burning down estates in order to make a statement. Thay've been heard, but they show no signs of stopping their streak of carnage.</p>
