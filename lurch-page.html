      <h1>YOU'VE BEEN REPLACED</h1>
      <p>When a machine could do as much work as three men, the labor force was quickly replaced by much more efficient androids. As the number of robots grew, jobs disappeared, and everyone in the middle class found themselves obsolete. While the wealthiest few prosper, most of humanity has been thrown into extreme poverty.</p>

      <h1>No one could have stopped it.</h1>
      <p>The creation of the android was supposed to make life better. Robots could take over the tasks that people didn't want to do, leaving more time for fun and leisure. But not only did the machines gladly perform whatever labor was asked of them, they could also perform job duties without the expectation of wages, benefits, or time off. Instead of improving the lives of everyone, the androids took their jobs.</p>
      <p>The entire middle class was soon thrown into poverty. As only the select elite enjoyed the fruits of their robot armies' labors, most of the population had to fight to survive. Their everyday struggles embittered them, further driving the rift between the classes.</p>
      <p>With such unrest, it was inevitable that someone would take matters into their own hands. The lurch has started burning down estates in order to make a statement. But even after their message has been heard, they show no signs of stopping their streak of carnage.</p>

      <p>Roemell has always lived in poverty. He's bounced from shelter to shelter, never able to stay in one place for too long. But now that his sister is pregnant and due any day, he would do almost anything to keep her safe.</p>    
      <p>Leona and Roemell find themselves thrown together. Even though they're from very different worlds,  they have one common goal: stop the terrorist before all of humanity is left in the lurch.</p>
