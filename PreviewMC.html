<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p class="first"><span class="four">A Note on the Science in Mental Contact</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="first">I do a lot of research while writing to ensure as much scientific accuracy as possible. For the setting of this novel, that was easy. In February 2017, astronomers discovered planets orbiting Trappist-1, the first star discovered using the Trappist telescope. There were seven planets found—the first six with potentially temperate climates and the seventh too far away and too cold to be inhabitable.</p>
<p>When these planets were announced by NASA, I had already drafted Mental Contact. But by fortunate coincidence, the fictional planetary system I had crafted also had seven planets with the seventh being icy cold. Without making too many changes, I was able to transport Jake and his crew to the Trappist-1 planetary system.</p>
<p>A particular detail that I wanted to handle delicately with a consideration to special relativity was the handling of warp travel—that is, space travel at speeds faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>It’s easy to consider space and time as independent, but they are actually intimately connected. If an object moves quickly through space, it actually moves slower through time. From any reference frame, time is experienced the same, but if the reference frame—say a spaceship traveling at high speeds—accelerates more than another—mission control on a planet—than the spaceship will experience less time passing than mission control. So while the people on the planet live out their lives at a normal pace, the space travelers on that space ship will actually age less.</p>
<p>In order to take this phenomenon known as time dilation into account, space travel in Jake’s universe works differently than in other fictional stories.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about spacetime, special relativity, and time dilation, I highly recommend reading <span class="em">A Brief History of Time</span> by Steven Hawking.</p>
<p>Aside from the science involved in the crafting of this novel, I hope readers will be able to take this work for what it is, a work of science fiction which examines the human mind while also asking, “What if...?”</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<h2><img src="01.gif" alt="01"/></h2>
<p class="first"><span class="four">I see things that </span>aren’t really there. Well, not things. Just her.</p>
<p>Lola.</p>
<p>Just the thought of her name pulled at the corners of my mind. <span class="em">You could stop taking the pills.</span> I could hear her voice whispering from within my brain. One silvery-blue pill each day kept my affliction under control. For that I was thankful. The side-effects, however, were steep. Sometimes I would wonder if it was better just to have the delusions. But it was a silly idea. <span class="em">No it’s not. You would finally be able to reach your full potential, and I could help.</span></p>
<p>I shook my head, trying to push her out of my mind. Consciously thinking about her could spiral into all-consuming obsession. If I dwelled on it too much, I’d start to hear her voice and convince myself that I would find her waiting just around the corner.</p>
<p>“Yo, Jake.” Adam’s face peeked through the doorway of our cabin, snapping me back to reality. He had the darkest complexion I’d ever seen. He was average height with short black hair, the same cut all of us Paradido crew members wore. “Stop playing with that tattered piece of junk and come out with me and the boys.”</p>
<p>“First, this is not a junk, it’s a book,” I said, holding up my novel. It was well worn and the binding was coming apart, but it still served its purpose. “Second, I’m busy.” I rolled over on my cot to turn away from him.</p>
<p>Adam shook his head. “Right, right, <span class="em">grandpa</span>. You’re too old to hang out with us <span class="em">youngins</span>.” At thirty, I was much older than most of the crew, but that wasn’t why I didn’t enjoy spending time with them. They reminded me constantly of what I wasn’t and what I couldn’t have.</p>
<p>“Maybe I am,” I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>Adam seemed to ignore my comment and continued, “We’re going to the movie theater—”</p>
<p>“I can’t see movies.” One of the many side-effects of the damn pills: I couldn’t make out holograms which included movies. </p>
<p>“I know. You didn’t let me finish.” Adam walked into the tiny, white, sterile room and sat on the edge of his cot so that he was right in my face. Other than the two cots, the only other piece of furniture in each of the cabins was a single white metal desk. “We’re going to the movie theater followed by the cantina on Baltic Street.”</p>
<p>“Everything on this planet is on Baltic Street.”</p>
<p>Adam nodded, and spoke slowly like I was some sort of idiot. “I know, but it’s our last night on Delta. You’ve spent way too much time on the surface cooped up in this ship reading your books. Get some fresh air while you still have a chance. Plus, I heard Alice is going to be there.”</p>
<p>I hated that my crewmates kept trying to push Alice on me. Every time we’d make deliveries and pickups on Delta they’d orchestrate some way to force me to spend time with her. I was hoping to avoid her this trip since we were only here for two days, but when Adam got like this, I knew he wouldn’t give up. “Fine. I’ll meet you fellows at the cantina.”</p>
<p>“Great,” Adam said as he stood up. “Movie ends around ten.”</p>
<p>I focused back on my book. I was more than ready for Adam to leave, yet he hung at the door.</p>
<p>“I expect to see you there, or we’re coming back to haul your ass out.”</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders in response while still concentrating on the page in front of me.</p>
<p>“All right, gramps. See you then.”</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I carefully climbed down the flimsy steps off of our spaceship, Paradido. My vertigo was worse on the surface, though for some reason it never bothered me while weightless in space. As I walked toward Baltic Street, I pulled my leather jacket close around my neck. I had forgotten how cold Delta could get at night. At least it wasn’t windy.</p>
<p>Looking behind me, Paradido was the only vehicle parked in the air-yard. The spaceship looked like a bloated pancake and was in desperate need of a new paint job. Patches of green had peeled away to show white underneath. At least there weren’t any other vessels nearby to compare it to. Delta didn’t get a lot of space traffic. </p>
<p>The gravel crunched under my boots as I walked up to the paved road. The sky was a cloudy gray above me. Everything about the planet was gray. Even the people looked ashen. It wasn’t merely an illusion; the mineral dust in the air coated everything in a thin dusting of drab.</p>
<p>The night was quiet, so I could hear the cantina’s noisy interior from far away. It appeared to be the only establishment open, and a warm glow filtered through the dirty windows.</p>
<p>I sucked in a deep breath before pushing the door open and entering the small bar. It was remarkably crowded. The air was full of loud conversation, laughter, and sloppy music played by a local band. I was ready to turn around and leave when I heard someone call out my name.</p>
<p>“Jake, over here!” I looked for the person shouting and saw Van waving at me. He was sitting at a table with Adam and all of the other crew members. There was a crowd of young women, and even a few men, fawning over them. Spacetravelers were novel to these simpletons. That reason alone made me dislike them.</p>
<p>I saw a woman in a short gray dress break away from the group and walk toward me. She looked dull amongst the colorful crowd, and disappointment washed over me when I recognized her. Alice smiled broadly as she approached me. She wasn’t the prettiest girl—her eyes were too far apart, her face was marred with freckles, and her two front teeth overlapped a little. But if she wanted to have sex with me, I’d say yes.</p>
<p>“Buy me a drink?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No thank you,” I said, crossing my arms in front of my chest. “Actually, I don’t feel too well. I might go back.”</p>
<p>She grasped my arm, keeping me from leaving. “Why don’t I buy you a drink? I bet it would make you feel a little more steady on your feet.” I hadn’t noticed that I had been wobbling. I nodded my head and let her lead me through the crowd to the bar. We stood there for a while waiting for the busy bartender to notice us.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the bartender nodded at Alice and yelled, “What’ll you have?”</p>
<p>“A fizzy-pink, please. What do you want, Jake?”</p>
<p>I responded directly to the bartender, “Scotch, straight up.”</p>
<p>When we got our drinks, I slammed mine down and set the empty glass on the bar while Alice sipped at her glowing cocktail. “Want to go hang with your mates?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit crowded in here. Why don’t we go for a walk instead?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” She set her still-half-full glass down on the counter and gave me a wide grin. Ugh, those overlapping teeth. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The air outside tasted gritty, but was still better than being inside the cantina. I’ve never done well with people, and loud crowds were even worse. Alice wrapped her hand around my arm and led me down the street back toward the air-yard.</p>
<p>“Your life must be so exciting. What’s it like? Flying in a spaceship?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. Every time we were together, she’d ask me mundane questions like this. She really needed to get out more. “I don’t know how to describe it.”</p>
<p>She hugged closer to my arm. “I’ve heard it’s like falling.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I guess.” There were worse ways to describe it.</p>
<p>“Have you ever gone faster than light?”</p>
<p>“Warp? Several times, actually.”</p>
<p>“That must have been so exciting,” she gushed.</p>
<p>“Not really.” I hated this kind of small talk. My mind was already scrambling for an excuse to get away from this woman.</p>
<p>“My friend told me that going that fast—faster than light—gives you the same feeling in the pit of your stomach as an orgasm.” She turned her head down, hiding her flushing face.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud. “Your friend’s wrong.” Achieving warp felt like a hand reaching down to your gut and ripping your stomach out. Maybe it felt similar to a really bad hookup. The last time I flew warp was over ten years ago, when I first arrived at this sad little planetary system. I hadn’t gotten a chance to leave. I probably never would. There was no way to keep my disappointment from leaking into my expression.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Did I upset you?”</p>
<p>I stopped walking and she turned toward me, her eyes examining my face. I wrapped one arm around her back and dramatically bit my lip. “Space travel isn’t as glamorous as most people think. It’s hard work and all the travel makes it impossible to keep lasting connections.”</p>
<p>“I thought people who work on spaceships get to take their families with them.”</p>
<p>Only those with high enough rank. But Paradido was a puny spaceship in the grand scheme of things. Not even our pilot could take his wife along with him. “Not always.”</p>
<p>Alice bit her lip, considering all of this. “Well, I’m not looking for a lasting connection right now.”</p>
<p>I placed my hand on her cheek and guided her lips to mine. My other hand slid down her back to the bottom hem of her dress and pulled it up.</p>
<p>She grabbed my roving palm. “I know somewhere we won’t be seen.”</p>
<p>We were almost back to the spaceship, but the desire to be physically close to another person took over. “Lead the way.”</p>
<p>We walked a little farther until we reached a set of storefronts with small apartments stacked on top. She ushered me to a small alley between the two brick building. Against one of the walls was a bin full of scrap metal large enough to hide two people. As soon as we were concealed behind the bin, Alice grasped my jacket and pulled me to her, kissing me deeply.</p>
<p>The sky was dark now; the only light from the safety lamps at the mines about a hundred yards away. Aside from the endless gray, my least favorite part about Delta was that the constant cloud cover obscured the stars.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of kissing, Alice finally worked her way down, her fingers fiddling with my pants. I leaned back against the wall, trying my best to simply enjoy.</p>
<p>“You ready?” She looked up at me, and the way the light caught her eyes made them look icy blue.</p>
<p>They reminded me of Lola’s eyes. Lola…</p>
<p>The blazing flash of white filled my vision while a stabbing pain pierced my head, stopping all of my thoughts. I can’t remember if I screamed or held onto my head with my hands.</p>
<p>I heard Alice’s voice. She sounded like she was shouting through a tunnel from far away. “… Jake… okay?”</p>
<p>I was sweating and freezing cold at the same time. My heart raced while my breathing became more and more difficult. I tried to concentrate on forming words through the searing pain in my head. “Get. Crew member. Fast.”</p>
<p>Everything went black as the gray ground rushed toward my face.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="fb">“Did you pack your toothbrush?” My mother was peeking through the door to my bedroom in our family suite, the pilot suite. This would be my first time I’d spend more than a couple weeks off the ship.</p>
<p class="fb">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="fb">“And your underwear?”</p>
<p class="fb">“Of course, Mom,” I said as I pushed the last of my clothes and pad into my already overstuffed bag. “I’m not a little kid anymore. I’m nineteen. I think I know how to pack.”</p>
<p class="fb">“I just worry, that’s all.” She leaned in to give me a kiss and I offered my cheek. “I’m so proud of you.”</p>
<p class="fb">“And Dad? He’s coming to see me off, too, right?”</p>
<p class="fb">A frown crossed her face, but she quickly recovered back to a look of maternal concern. “You know your father has to work.”</p>
<p class="fb">“He’s still upset I didn’t get into Aldrin Academy.” I hefted my bag over my shoulder and tried not to show the strain of its weight on my face.</p>
<p class="fb">Mom stepped back from the door making room for me to pass through and followed me out of our suite and into the hall. “He’s proud of you. Trappist has an excellent academy.”</p>
<p class="fb">“But not enough to take two minutes off to say goodbye,” I muttered.</p>
<p class="fb">Mom didn’t comment and just kept walking toward the air-dock. Spaceship Titanium was huge. I knew my way around the parts that were pertinent to my life, but the rest of the ship was a mystery. My favorite place on the spaceship had been the bridge. It had a strict ‘no children’ rule, but since my dad was the pilot, he had made an exception for me. I had never been to the air-dock, but Mom seemed to know the way. We traversed several hallways before taking an elevator down.</p>
<p class="fb">The air-dock wasn’t nearly as impressive as I had imagined. There was a row of the smallest passenger warp spaceships I had ever seen, along with a collection of even smaller vessels covered in Universal Military symbols.</p>
<p class="fb">When we got to my gate, Mom stopped me for a moment and adjusted the collar of my uniform. “You’re going to do great things, Jake.”</p>
<p class="fb">My voice wavered as I asked, “Will I see you and Dad again?”</p>
<p class="fb">She patted my shoulders. “Of course you will.” I could tell by the look in her eyes that she wasn’t sure either. “Be good.”</p>
<p class="fb">“I will. I should get on.” I hugged Mom goodbye, then boarded the small vessel.</p>
<p class="fb">Since the shuttle had been chartered to take me to Trappist, there were no other passengers. Reserving warp transportation was expensive, but my family could afford it. I had this shuttle booked to take me to Theta Academy on the planet Theta in the Trappist system, and another scheduled to bring me back on my projected graduation date.</p>
<p class="fb">The distance between our current location and my destination was five light-years, which translated to an eight-hour transit time. Time works weird when traveling so much faster than the speed of light. The current students at Theta Academy would all graduate before I’d even get there. My parents would also age more than me during my flight—unless they were also traveling at warp. Since my dad was a pilot, he was frequently traveling that fast. In fact, I could potentially age more than them while going to school as they travel around the universe at warp speeds.</p>
<p class="fb">I tried to calm all the racing thoughts on relativity as the ship took off, preparing myself for the acceleration to warp by clenching my hands around the armrests. I had done the jump so many times, but no one ever really gets used to it. Still, I wasn’t going to be one of those people puking their guts out after we reached cruising speed.</p>
<p class="fb">Once the ship was steady, I let myself relax. I had been so anxious the night before, I had barely slept. Now that I finally had a chance to loosen up, I dozed off and only woke up when we were slowing down.</p>
<p class="fb">“This is your pilot speaking. We are approaching our destination, planet Theta of the Trappist planetary system. It is now year 3127, day 17, hour 8:42 in universal time, and year 60K 142, hour 26:07 local time.” Those numbers didn’t even make sense. I thought everyone used universal time, which consisted of roughly 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day. I knew that the system had been settled within the past few centuries, so their year must have been much shorter than a universal year.</p>
<p class="fb">I watched the terrain whiz by as we landed. An uneasy feeling grew from the pit of my stomach as I took in the location of my academy. Theta appeared to be deserted. I didn’t see a single plant, animal, building, or structure.</p>
<p class="fb">By the time I had my bag and had found the shuttle to the academy, I was convinced that coming here had been a huge mistake. But during the shuttle ride to campus, a beautiful girl wearing the academy uniform turned and stared at me with clear blue eyes. I looked up and as soon as I made eye-contact with her, she rolled her eyes then turned back to face forward.</p>
<p class="fb">I could have sworn she had been smiling while she looked at me. Just that one friendly smile put me more at ease. </p>

<h2><img src="02.gif" alt="02"/></h2>
<p class="first"><span class="four">The beautiful face from</span> the shuttle slowly dissolved from my vision as I was brought back to the present.</p>
<p>“Jake, Jake!”</p>
<p>The room was too bright. I could barely open my eyes.</p>
<p>“Jake? Do you know where you are?” the doctor asked.</p>
<p>“I better not still be in that fucking alley.” My tongue felt like a sack of rocks, but I’d be back to normal in an hour or so.</p>
<p>“Do you know my name?”</p>
<p>“How could I ever forget you?” The doctor peered at me from above, his poofs of white hair and trim pale beard making his lined face almost disappear into the alabaster ceiling.</p>
<p>Adam’s voice came next. “Given the classic Metcalf wit, I’d say he’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get ahead of yourself, Adam,” I said. “That’s Doc’s call.”</p>
<p>“He’s fine,” Doc proclaimed before taking off his exam gloves and throwing them in my face.</p>
<p>I heard Doc’s footsteps fade away and turned my head to see Adam sitting in a chair next to the cot I was laying on. Now that Doc was gone, Adam’s expression changed from amused to concerned.</p>
<p>“They’re happening more often,” he said.</p>
<p>I sat up and touched the sore spot at my temple. I could feel the knot just under my skin. It must have been caused by the fall. “You think I haven’t noticed?”</p>
<p>“Stop making a fucking joke about everything. I’m serious.”</p>
<p>I caught my reflection in the mirror above the hand wash station and saw the red and purple bruise which covered a quarter of my face. No wonder it hurt so badly. “I’ll worry about me, and you worry about you.”</p>
<p>Adam looked down to the floor and shook his head. I didn’t need his concern. These episodes were just a side-effect of my medication. They weren’t going to kill me.</p>
<p>“Did they delay the launch because of me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Commander Ford was going to if you didn’t wake up within the hour. Guess that means we’re back on schedule.” Adam turned away and walked out of the medical room.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="fb">I was nervous; it was my first class at Theta Academy, and I really wanted to make a good impression. I had arrived at the lecture hall ten minutes early in order to secure a seat in the front. Slowly, the room filled with students, and our professor came in the minute class was scheduled to start.</p>
<p class="fb">When I started up my pad, it displayed a hologram of the campus and all the buildings at the academy. I swiped my hand through the image to make it go away. The last thing I needed was to let my peers know that I couldn’t even find my way to class without help.</p>
<p class="fb">“Hello, young and eager minds,” the professor’s voice boomed through the room. “Welcome to Navigation One. I am your professor, Dr. Pierce. At the end of this course, you will all be intimately familiar with the locations of all colonized planetary systems. Who here can tell me the span of the currently settled systems?”</p>
<p class="fb">I had heard this number several times from my father and had even read the first chapter of the class text-file before I left Spaceship Titanium. I shot up my hand to answer.</p>
<p class="fb">“The eager young man in the front.”</p>
<p class="fb">“87 light-years,” I said with confidence.</p>
<p class="fb">“That would have been right four years ago. Who knows the correct number?”</p>
<p class="fb">Dr. Pierce pointed at another student. “You, sir.”</p>
<p class="fb">“89 light-years.”</p>
<p class="fb">“Very good.”</p>
<p class="fb">I sunk down in my chair, thoroughly embarrassed. I hadn’t considered that things would change during my five years in transit. For the rest of the lecture, I kept quiet and stared at my pad.</p>
<p class="fb">When Dr. Pierce dismissed us, I put my pad into my backpack and raced out of the side exit as quickly as I could. I would take the back exit to avoid all of my classmates. The unfortunate truth, however, was that I had no idea how to navigate this building. I blindly walked down one hall after another looking for a door leading outside. Once I encountered a fourth dead end, I pulled out my pad to bring up a map of the building.</p>
<p class="fb">As I was focusing on the pathways depicted on my pad, a voice startled me.</p>
<p class="fb">“You lost?”</p>
<p class="fb">I looked up to see the face of the woman from the shuttle. She was absolutely stunning with pale skin, long white hair, and icy-blue eyes. She had thick blond eyelashes and a straight nose.</p>
<p class="fb">“I’m fine,” I said. “I know my way out.”</p>
<p class="fb">She pursed her glossy pink lips and looked at me for a moment before saying, “You know, everyone makes a fool of themselves on their first day. You’re not special.”</p>
<p class="fb">I winced. I had built up this whole persona for the woman on the shuttle. In my mind she was friendly, welcoming, and even a bit playful. Instead, the real person in front of me was curt and pompous.</p>
<p class="fb">“You want to be a pilot?” I asked. Of course the goal of Theta Academy was to train future pilots, but most students would secure other jobs aboard starships after graduation.</p>
<p class="fb">She merely shrugged her shoulders. “If <span class="em">you</span> want to be a pilot, you should really learn how to navigate your school first.” She gave me a sly smile before walking away.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Paradido had a small crew, so all the seats for lift-off and landing were situated on the bridge. It was a circular room with panels lining one half and seats taking up the other. In the center were the pilot and commander’s chairs. Near the pilot’s chair was a ladder leading up to the observation deck which had the largest window in the entire spaceship. It was also my favorite spot on the little ship. </p>
<p>This bridge looked like a closet compared to those on the spaceships my father had piloted. I had given up hope of ever traveling at warp or seeing my family again. The last time I had seen my mother was when I had left for the academy eleven years ago. Now I was thirty years old, at least according to universal, time-travel adjusted.</p>
<p>I tightened my restraints a little more as Pilot Greene counted down for launch. Greene carried himself like any other retired military man, making his short, compact stature seem imposing. He grew a thick brown beard which made him look much older than his actual age of twenty-seven. I knew the controls were lit up with holograms of all sorts of dials, switches, buttons, and indicators, but I couldn’t see them. Greene’s fingers seemed to dance in front of him as Ford looked around and read off invisible numbers and systems.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Adam whispered from next to me.</p>
<p>I swallowed and nodded. The whole spaceship started rumbling as the engines kicked in and Paradido lifted off the ground. The best way to describe the feeling of lift-off is to imagine an elephant sitting on top of you with another elephant sitting on the first. It was hard to even breathe, and new crew members would often pass out on their first few flights.</p>
<p>Escaping Delta’s gravity didn’t take long, maybe twenty minutes. “All right, folks, we’re on autopilot now,” Greene said. “Thirty days until we reach Zeta.”</p>
<p>Zeta wasn’t as bad as Delta, but it certainly wasn’t my favorite planet in the system. It was too hot and just as small as Delta. Come to think about it, I wasn’t fond of any of the planets in Trappist.</p>
<p>The room filled with the sound of clanking metal as everyone unbuckled their restraints.</p>
<p>“Let’s get to work, men,” Ford said. Ford didn’t have much of a role in navigating the ship, that was Greene’s job, but he did have full authority over the crew.</p>
<p><span class="em">You should stay here. Watch the view.</span></p>
<p>Ignoring her voice, I carefully navigated out of the bridge using the yellow rope handles on the wall to propel myself forward. Paradido didn’t have any advanced features like an artificial gravity generator. Although weightlessness made moving around the ship a lot faster, if anyone skimped on their exercises during the flight they’d collapse like a wet noodle once we landed.</p>
<p>Normally, I would have been able to take a break right after lift-off, but I had been unconscious for the pre-flight operations and had a lot of work to catch up on.</p>
<p>My supplies were in the engine room located at the back of the ship. I floated down the crude looking halls, exposed metal flashing and ducts lining the walls. Diamond-patterned steel covered the floor and ceiling. The same handles as on the bridge also dotted the hallways. I reached for the next handle as someone came up from behind me. “Going to go swab the deck?” Van asked as he raced past. For a big guy, he could get around really fast. He was tall and heavy and his face looked like molded dough punctured with a round nose and two beady eyes.</p>
<p>“Har har.” I made it to the engine room and opened the supply closet. It was quiet since the engine wouldn’t need to run again until we approached Zeta.</p>
<p>I had to pause a moment. My episode had sucked out all of my energy. I should have gotten some sleep, but knew that Adam was probably already in the mess room brewing coffee. I’d just grab some in a beverage pouch on my way to the cabins.</p>
<p><span class="em">If you didn’t fight it, you wouldn’t have the episodes.</span></p>
<p>It was a lie. As long as I kept taking those damned pills, I would continue to suffer from intense headaches and blackouts. I grabbed my pressure mop, a bottle of cleaning solution, and my gloves. I just needed to keep busy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="fb">Even though I was already doing well in all my classes, I spent most of my time in the library. My roommate had an acrid smell about him which had permeated our entire dorm room. Since he spent most of his time in our room, I did not.</p>
<p class="fb">School had always been easy for me. I thought that going to flight academy would finally present me with an academic challenge, but I had been wrong. Instead, I read texts that were meant for advanced study. I memorized every bit of information I came across. I could rattle off the names of every inhabited planet in alphabetical order and also in the order in which they were settled. It was a long list—easily over two hundred names.</p>
<p class="fb">I learned all about my current planetary system, Trappist. I researched the history for each warp spaceship. I knew everything.</p>
<p class="fb">One day while I was working in the library, something other than my studies caught my attention. The pale woman with her white hair cascading down her back browsed the stacks of books, picking random ones and leafing through them before returning them to the shelves. I was having a hard time concentrating. I kept finding myself admiring her instead of looking at my pad.</p>
<p class="fb">She glanced over at me and caught me staring. I quickly looked down pretending to be engrossed in my studies, hoping she hadn’t noticed me watching her. Instead, she walked over and leaned against my study table. I cleared my throat and kept my eyes on my pad. “I’m busy.”</p>
<p class="fb">With a flick of her finger, the hologram of Spaceship Cobalt began to spin. “Reading about warp ships? Why bother?” </p>
<p class="fb">I pushed my hand onto my pad to turn it off and tucked it into my backpack. “I’m going to be a pilot of one of these ships some day.”</p>
<p class="fb">“That’s never going to happen.” She examined her fingernails for a moment before glaring at me with those ice-blue eyes.</p>
<p class="fb">I leaned back, putting more space between us. “You don’t know that.”</p>
<p class="fb">She walked around the table and sat in the seat across from me. “Sure I do. It’s simple probability. There are forty-five students at Theta Academy, and hundreds of other pilot academies around the universe. Thousands of students graduate with flight degrees each year. That’s a lot of pilots. And how many warp ships are there? Three hundred?”</p>
<p class="fb">“Three hundred thirty-two.”</p>
<p class="fb">“Right, three thirty-two. And how many of their pilots came from Aldrin Academy?”</p>
<p class="fb">I paused. “All of them.”</p>
<p class="fb">“Well, there you go. Theta Academy just doesn’t produce warp pilots. If we’re really lucky, we’ll get pilot positions on regular spaceships. The rest will probably only land jobs as officers and crew. Face it, we’re all bound to this system.”</p>
<p class="fb">I crossed my arms. “I’m not getting stuck anywhere. Especially not here.”</p>
<p class="fb">“I wouldn’t be so confident about that.” The way she said it sent a chill down my spine. She got up and sauntered away.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I did a half-assed job on all of my work duties before taking a break. Ford would have disapproved if he knew I had quit early, but he spent most of his time in his office or the rec room. I wouldn’t run into him on the bridge.</p>
<p>The best thing about the bridge was the observation deck. The windows in front of the pilot’s seat extended up into a dome above the entire bridge. There was a metal catwalk ten feet above the floor which made a circle near the top. There was a ladder to get up there, but with no gravity, I just had to jump up from the floor.</p>
<p>I settled down on the catwalk and watched outer space above me. I had spent too much time in my life traveling faster than light with a view of only darkness through the windows. If I had to point out one thing I learned from my eleven (universal) years on Trappist, it was that sometimes, you just have to slow down and look at the stars.</p>
<p><span class="em">Over there. An asteroid.</span></p>
<p>I looked in the direction my mind was pointing to before I could stop myself. Sure enough, something was off. I knew the star charts better than I knew myself. To the left of Polaris was a mass that wasn’t supposed to be there. It was an asteroid.</p>
<p>I sat up so quickly that I bashed my head against the thick window. I held my hand against the sore spot on my temple. At least now my face would have symmetrical bruising.</p>
<p>I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my gut. Without any evidence to support it, I just knew that the asteroid was coming straight for us. I needed to find Pilot Greene. <span class="em">There’s no time. You need to navigate the spaceship out of its path.</span></p>
<p>“I can’t. I can’t see the controls.” I had a general sense of where the throttle was, but without the ability to see holograms, I couldn’t be sure of it’s exact position.</p>
<p><span class="em">You know where they are and how they work. You can do this.</span> I took a deep breath and climbed down from the observation deck to just in front of the control panels. I would have to act fast. I tried to reach my hands out to the steering yoke and froze. <span class="em">You can do this.</span> Doubt flooded my body, stretching to even the ends of my fingertips. I had never done these maneuvers myself. My brain was actively feeding me misinformation and making me hear someone who wasn’t there. In the end, I didn’t trust myself with my own life. I needed to find the pilot.</p>
<p>Where would Greene be right now? The mess? His cabin? I decided to check the mess first.</p>
<p>The only person there was Adam. He was cooking something that smelled horrible. Normally I’d give him a dig for it, but I didn’t have much time.</p>
<p>“Adam! Have you seen Greene?”</p>
<p>Adam turned to face me, goo detaching from his spoon in spherical globs. “Why?” He was attempting to heat something in an uncovered container—whatever it was spreading out from the side of the bowl and sloshing everywhere. I hated Adam’s cooking experiments since I was the one who always had to clean up after them.</p>
<p>“It’s urgent. Where is he?”</p>
<p>Adam chuckled. “You have nothing but time, Metcalf. I’m not getting pulled into some prank.”</p>
<p>Feeling my life slip away as the giant rock was hurtling toward us, I raised my voice. “Just tell me where he is, dammit!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,” Adam said, holding his hands up, the gesture splashing goo onto the walls. “He went to the rec room.”</p>
<p>I didn’t waste a moment and propelled myself directly to the rec room. When I got there, Greene and Officer Cory were in the middle of a game of handball.</p>
<p>By then, I was so anxious I could barely speak. “Pilot Greene… I saw… there’s a… an asteroid.”</p>
<p>I now had both men’s full attention. They came rushing out of the room and raced down the halls. I followed them back to the bridge.</p>
<p>“Where?” Greene asked.</p>
<p>I pointed to the mass I had spotted just moments earlier. Greene rushed to the pilot’s chair and started poking at all the panels that I couldn’t see. </p>
<p>“Oh shit,” Cory muttered, his pale complexion getting even paler. He got into the commander seat and buckled the restraints.</p>
<p>Greene looked up at the asteroid and said, “The scan of the system didn’t show any particulates that could potentially cross our path. This doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
<p>“It’s heading toward us?” My heart was hammering in my</p>
<p>chest. It looked so much closer already. We wouldn’t have enough time.</p>
<p>“Officer Cory, enact emergency collision protocol,” Greene said.</p>
<p>Cory nodded and said, “Yes, sir.” He touched some invisible button in the air, and then his voice boomed through the entire ship. “Emergency. Emergency. Secure yourselves for anti-collision maneuvers.”</p>
<p>It was heading toward us. I jumped to my seat, the same one I had used for lift-off only hours ago.</p>
<p>Paradido’s engines roared as it abruptly banked to the left. The asteroid was now big enough to see the cloud of dust around it and a few of the pocks on its gray surface. It looked like it was still coming straight for us. </p>
<p>I watched it get bigger and bigger as it drew closer. My hands started trembling as I gripped my restraints. This was it. This was how I was going to die.</p>
<p>Greene muttered incessantly to himself as he banked the ship farther to the left. I could feel my body getting pulled to the port side of the ship as we kept turning. The asteroid seemed to change minutely in relation to us, but not enough. </p>
<p>“Hold on,” Green said as he swung his arms quickly to the right, and the ship followed, spinning rapidly. The asteroid whipped across the windows over and over. I could no longer tell which direction either it or us were going.</p>
<p>The engines ramped up even louder as we picked up speed. Our spinning motion slowed to a stop. I could feel my body getting crushed against the back of my seat as the asteroid got larger and larger until it filled the entire window.</p>
<p><span class="em">If you had been paying closer attention to me, this wouldn’t have happened.</span></p>
<p>I tried to scream, but my throat wouldn’t cooperate. My eyes filled with a blinding light which didn’t go away even after I closed them. So this was how I’d die, sinking into another episode.</p>
<p><span class="em">You’ll live. But take this as warning. You need to stop ignoring me.</span></p>

<h2><img src="03.gif" alt="03"/></h2>
<p class="fb"><span class="four">“Okay, seriously. How much </span>time do you spend in here?” Yet again, the pale woman interrupted me while I was studying in the library. Today she had her white hair up in a ponytail, a style which showed off her angular face.</p>
<p class ="fb">I shut down my pad and looked at her. “Why do you care?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“It’s out of the ordinary. Anything abnormal piques my interest.”</p>
<p class ="fb">“I’m not abnormal,” I muttered as I put my pad in my bag.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Perhaps. I don’t know you well enough to make that judgment.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I slung on my backpack and turned away from her while rolling my eyes.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Where are you from?” she asked.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Nowhere. Everywhere. Why do you care?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“I’m just trying to make conversation. I don’t really have anyone to talk to. You’re the first person at this academy to even acknowledge me.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I let out a dry laugh. “Seriously? Pretty girls like you always have tons of friends.”</p>
<p class ="fb">“I am serious. I would never lie. Also, you didn’t answer my question. Where are you from?”</p>
<p class ="fb">I walked toward the exit of the library, and she eagerly walked next to me, waiting for my answer. I sighed and told her, “I grew up on Spaceship Titanium. My dad is the pilot. I was actually born when Titanium was in transit from Sol to Sirius. My mom used to say that she was in labor for three years before she had me.”</p>
<p class ="fb">She perked up and grabbed my arm. “You’ve been to Sol? What’s it like?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“My parents were there. I’ve never been.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I opened the door to the library and held it open for her. She exited, then paused and turned back to look at me. “I’ve been on Trappist for as long as I can remember. I’ve always dreamed of what it’d be like to leave. I want to explore the universe.”</p>
<p class ="fb">As we walked from the paved steps in front of the library to the sandy black soil which covered this planet, I thought about how boring it must be to stay in one place. Theta was a desolate planet with no vegetation or animals. The sky was red and only got darker red at nightfall. Other planets had skies which transitioned through the entire spectrum of colors at dusk. The stars, which could only have been seen on a really clear day, looked pink through Theta’s dusty atmosphere.</p>
<p class ="fb">I was on autopilot, walking directly back to my dorm building. I had no idea where she was going.</p>
<p class ="fb">I had been lost in my thoughts for a while when she finally broke the silence. “All that time you spend in the library, have you ever looked up more about Trappist?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“Sure. It was first settled about two hundred years ago…” I knew the exact year it was settled, the names of the planets, and the order they were inhabited. I knew the system capitol was located on the planet Kappa, and Beta was covered in water. I knew that Chi was the only planet in the system that didn’t have people living there because it was too cold.</p>
<p class ="fb">“You don’t know nearly as much as you think you do.” Before I could ask her what she meant, she turned and dashed into one of the women’s dorms.</p>
<p class ="fb">I doubted there was anything interesting to learn about the Trappist planetary system, but I would humor her. Whoever she was. I had once again forgotten to ask for her name.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class ="fb">I had made it through my first quarter at Theta. I looked up my scores on my pad—top performance in every area. I was especially proud of my grade in Intro to Navigation. Over the past hundred days I had also done so much independent study that I planned on taking the prelim exams to test out of the next few courses. If I could be the best student who came through Theta Academy, I would be on track to becoming a warp spaceship pilot just like my father.</p>
<p class ="fb">I left my dorm early in the morning and took the sandy path to the engineering building. The sky was a dark blood red in the low light. I’d been on Theta for a few months now and still hadn’t gotten used to the color of the sky. The planet would make a good setting for a horror movie.</p>
<p class ="fb">Most of the other students were on Kappa, the closest planet to Theta, for the break between quarters. The way my classmates described Kappa made it sound like an idyllic place. Maybe next break, if I didn’t have anything else going on, I could head there with a few of my new friends.</p>
<p class ="fb">There was a sign just inside the entrance of the engineering building stating that the prelim exams were being held down the hall to the left. I walked down the quiet hall past darkened classrooms. Only one door was open, and I went in.</p>
<p class ="fb">A few of the desks were already occupied. The only student in the room that I recognized was the pale woman. She sat near the door and turned to glance at me as I walked in. She looked back at her own desk, tapping her fingers impatiently.</p>
<p class ="fb">“I think we’ve got everyone now,” Dr. Pierce said as I took a seat near the one person I knew. “Let’s begin, shall we?” I looked at my watch. Even arriving ten minutes early, I had been the last one here. How early had the others shown up?</p>
<p class ="fb">Dr. Pierce passed out exam pads with their corresponding glasses. “Let me go over the guidelines before you all get started. You’re each allowed to take as many exams as you would like, but the testing period will be for only four hours, so use your time wisely. You may work on the exams in whichever order you choose. Only the ones that you submit will be graded. For example, if you finish three exams but don’t submit any of them before the four hours are up, you won’t get credit for any of them. I’ll have the time left displayed on the front board.” A glowing 4:00:00 appeared on the front wall. “That’s all. You may begin.”</p>
<p class ="fb">The number on the wall started counting down. I put on my glasses and started up my exam pad. The special glasses enabled me to see the holograms projected from my pad. As I quickly glanced around the room, everyone else’s pads appeared dark to me.</p>
<p class ="fb">I started with navigation since I knew it the best and could finish those tests quickly. I planned on taking the exams for NAV102, along with NAV210 and NAV211. The first displayed in front of me, showing a map of the inhabited universe. Question one asked me to find Kapteyn’s Star. I smiled. This was going to be easy.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Psst!”</p>
<p class ="fb">I turned to find the source of the whisper. The pale woman was looking at me, her white hair tumbling down in large curls which hid her pad.</p>
<p class ="fb">I shook my head. These exams were too important to get distracted, but she persisted. “Psst! Hey. I’m talking to you.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I shushed her and tried to focus on my pad. I wouldn’t let her distract me again.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Come on, I need some help. <span class="em">Please?</span>”</p>
<p class ="fb">“Stop talking to me,” I hissed between my teeth.</p>
<p class ="fb">She responded at a louder whisper, “Dr. Pierce is mostly deaf. He can’t hear us.” I glanced at the professor lounging in a chair behind the lectern. Instead of the normal green glow coming from his ear, it shone red. He must have turned his hearing assistive device off. “I can’t read my exam.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I looked back at her. “You need to put the glasses on.” How had she made it through an entire term without learning how to take an exam?</p>
<p class ="fb">“I dropped them.”</p>
<p class ="fb">“Then look for them.” Turning back to my pad, I tried to concentrate on the next question: something about Wolf 1061. I moved my hand to pan through the map of the galaxy and tapped the correct star.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Can I use yours?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“No!” I said it too loudly, and Dr. Pierce turned his attention to me.</p>
<p class ="fb">“Mr. Metcalf, there’s to be no talking during the exam. If I hear another word from you, you’ll have to leave and won’t get credit for any of your exams.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I nodded sullenly to show I understood before trying to get back to the test. After breezing through the next few solar systems, I heard her whisper, “Psst,” again. This time, I didn’t even look over, I just kept my eyes down. Question ten: In which galaxy is the settled universe?</p>
<p class ="fb">“I need help,” she whimpered. I looked at her through the corner of my eye. “How many planets does Groombridge have?”</p>
<p class ="fb">I sighed. “Which Groombridge, A or B?” </p>
<p class ="fb">She looked down at her pad. She still wasn’t wearing her glasses. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I shrugged my shoulders. I couldn’t—but also shouldn’t—help her out. Looking back at my pad, I read the next question. “How many planets does Groombridge…” No way. I blinked my eyes to make sure I was seeing the question right. Was she somehow able to read my pad? I glanced back at her, and she was finally wearing her glasses and working on her test. With the flick of my hand, I was able to move the star map and see the rest of the question. A. Groombridge 34A had one planet, although it wasn’t habitable. I marked the correct answer and moved on.</p>
<p class ="fb">Suddenly, she stood up and started talking at a normal speaking volume. “This is too easy. I can’t believe I didn’t get into Aldrin and had to go to this shit academy instead.” I gasped. Dr. Pierce didn’t even glance in our direction. “Forget this exam. I’m out of here. Come with me.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I shook my head violently. There was no way I was going to leave with her. “Suit yourself.” She flipped her hair over her shoulder and left the room, leaving the exam pad and glasses on her desk.</p>
<p class ="fb">For a fleeting moment, I wanted to grab her glasses and see how far she’d even gotten on her exams. As I continued working, the thought kept breaching my mind and ruining my concentration. She had only stayed for the first fifteen minutes. There was no way she actually finished anything, right?</p>
<p class ="fb">Finally, my curiosity won out. Dr. Pierce was still sitting back at the desk, but now he had a pad in front of him and was working on a word puzzle. I quickly grabbed the exam and glasses from her desk. After swapping glasses and powering up her pad, I was able to see her exam progress. Each one showed as 100% complete, but not submitted. Perhaps she just filled in gibberish. I opened one exam and flipped through her answers. It looked like she had gotten them all right. Then I checked a second exam, and a third one.</p>
<p class ="fb">“What the…?”</p>
<p class ="fb">“Mr. Metcalf.” Oh, shit. I had made too much noise. And now that I had another student’s pad and glasses on my desk, I could also expect to be expelled or at least put on probation. Shit, shit, shit. “Please stand up and leave the exam room.”</p>
<p class ="fb">I looked down at the desk. Could I somehow move the other pad without Dr. Pierce knowing?</p>
<p class ="fb">“Now,” he said, his voice sharp. I had no choice but to leave it. I scrambled out of my desk and walked out the room as quickly as I could.</p>
<p class ="fb">It wasn’t until I reached the front door of the building that the full ramifications hit me. It wouldn’t be so bad to take the course for NAV102, but what about the other pad? I leaned against the wall and slid down until I was seated on the floor, then covered my face with my hands. “Fuck,” I yelled out, hearing my voice reverberate through the building. At least the five-light-year distance between me and my parents meant that my father wouldn’t find out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="sb">•••</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="em">I told you you’d be fine.</span></p>
<p>My head was still foggy. I slowly opened my eyes, giving them a chance to adjust. How long had I been out this time? A few minutes? An hour?</p>
<p>I expected to find myself in the medical room, but instead I was still strapped into my seat on the bridge. The room was dark with only the slightest glow coming from the control panels and the stars visible through the window.</p>
<p>Where had that asteroid come from? If my medication hadn’t take away my ability to see holograms, I could have reviewed the asteroid trajectory on the panels. Instead, I had to be careful to stay a certain distance from them, or else I might inadvertently push a button or flip a switch. I remembered the control panels on the warp spaceship my dad had piloted, but had never actually seen the controls for Paradido. I imagined it had basic, rudimentary controls and gauges.</p>
<p>Extracting myself from the restraints, I got up from my seat. My vision swirled, and I had to take a moment to steady myself. After a few deep breaths, I felt better. I pushed against the floor of the bridge to propel myself up to the observation deck. </p>
<p>I examined the stars through the window. The view was the same from all the planets in Trappist. As you travel around the inhabited universe, the orientation of some of the stars changes, making the star-scape slightly different on each planetary system. But Orion looked the same from every inhabited planet. I traced his belt with my finger, wishing that I could once again travel through the stars.</p>
<p><span class="em">Something is missing.</span></p>
<p>I examined the sky, trying to see if anything was out of place. Orion’s shoulders were both there, along with the bottom two stars.</p>
<p><span class="em">Think about it.</span></p>
<p>I sighed. Critical thinking was no longer my strong suit: another side-effect of my meds. I listed off the names of the stars making the constellation at a whisper. They weren’t a hologram.</p>
<p><span class="em">What should you be seeing?</span></p>
<p>What should I see out of a spaceship window mid-flight? Stars. Everything was how it was supposed to be. I rubbed my hands over my face. I shouldn’t entertain these thoughts. Maybe I had been out for longer than just an hour. I was hungry; I probably just needed to get something to eat.</p>
