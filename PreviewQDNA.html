  <p class="first em">Saturday, October 18, 2059</p>

  <p class="first">Irene Crow fiddled with the papers in her file, her fingers worrying the corners of the white pages. She still couldn&rsquo;t believe it was true. But DNA doesn&rsquo;t lie. It can&rsquo;t.</p>

  <p>Her best friend&rsquo;s room was just ahead on the left. A nurse smiled at her from down the hall and Irene dipped her head and muttered, &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo; Yesterday, she had been here for moral support. Today, she was here for work. She adjusted her cream-colored blazer and took a deep breath before knocking firmly on the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Identification,&rdquo; came an automated voice. Irene dug her device out of her pocket and held it up to the security panel next to the door. The small electronic in her hand displayed her credentials, including a picture of her dark, smiling face framed by her unruly, black, curly hair. Her device gave a shrill beep, meaning her identification had been scanned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on official business with the state department,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your admittance has been approved. You may enter.&rdquo; There was a soft click of the door unlocking, and Irene let herself in.</p>

  <p>The room might as well have been a palace. She wondered how much it cost per night. Whatever the price, Annette could afford it. In the corner, bathed in natural light from the wall of windows, Annette sat propped up on her bed with her tiny new baby in her arms. Her wavy brown hair was in a ratty mess and there were dark circles under her eyes. Even though she must have been exhausted, she seemed to be glowing as she admired her infant. She looked up and saw Irene standing just inside the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Irene, come meet my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene walked slowly across the room. She had never been a fan of children, least of all babies. They all looked the same: small and wrinkled. Standing stiffly next to Annette&rsquo;s bed, she looked over the small child. The infant&rsquo;s face was set in a frown and her hands were balled in little fists. &ldquo;Hi, baby,&rdquo; Irene said, not sure how to address this new little person.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like to hold her?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; She set down her file on the table next to the bed and held out her arms. Annette carefully handed her the baby. Irene cradled the tightly wrapped infant, afraid to move. She might wake the baby, or worse yet, drop her. The tiny, scrunched face looked almost alien to her. Did all people start out looking like that? &ldquo;Have you settled on a name yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ophelia.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ophelia. It&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo; She stood still, not trusting herself to even rock the child. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, Ophelia.&rdquo; As if on cue, Ophelia started fussing and kicking her little legs. &ldquo;Oh, I&hellip; uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Annette said, holding out her arms. Irene quickly transferred the baby back to her mother. Within a few seconds she stopped fussing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; Irene said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I wasn&rsquo;t here for her birth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. The nurses said they prefer it when the support person ducks out before things get too intense. I guess they&rsquo;ve done a lot of deliveries working around a husband passed out on the floor. Plus, Jamie was amazing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene nodded in agreement. Even before the nurse had asked her to don scrubs, she had started feeling light-headed. Her wife, Jamie, had stepped in and held Annette&rsquo;s hand as the doctor performed a routine C-section while Irene sat in the waiting room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>

  <p>Irene couldn&rsquo;t hide her concerned expression. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually here on official business.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh great, you found the DNA match for Ophelia&rsquo;s father. I&rsquo;m not going to request child support or anything. Hell, I don&rsquo;t even need his name. Just his medical history for Ophelia&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene grabbed her discarded file. She opened it and looked at the top page. All the information in this file was already locked in her brain. She closed the folder and set it back on the table. Pulling her device from her pocket, she said, &ldquo;Begin recording,&rdquo; and placed it on top of the file. &ldquo;Tell me, Annette, about the circumstances surrounding your daughter&rsquo;s conception.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette looked up at Irene and raised a brow. &ldquo;You already know all the details of how I got pregnant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But could you just repeat it for the record?&rdquo; Irene asked, motioning to her device.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cut the crap, Irene. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene sighed. She picked up her device, pressed her thumb on the screen to stop the recording, and shoved it back in her pocket. Placing a hand on the file, she took a deep breath. &ldquo;Ophelia&rsquo;s father is dead. He died six years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <h1 id="chap01">one</h1>

  <p class="first em">Saturday February 1, 2059</p>

  <p class="first">Annette bobbed her head to the thumping music at the club. With drink in hand, she surveyed the crowd. Intoxicated patrons grinded against each other on the illuminated dance floor, while others queued at the bar to order more drinks. She was used to swanky clubs with actual human bartenders instead of the automated drink vending kiosks at this establishment. There was even a cup deposit in case any of the glowing glassware got stolen or broken, a tacky detail which made her want to leave. But she was on a mission. She had to stay.</p>

  <p>Irene had recommended Echo when Annette asked her which dive was best. This venue certainly delivered. If only Irene had been able to come out tonight. Hell, Annette would have even settled for Irene&rsquo;s cute Korean wife. Instead, she had Clara.</p>

  <p>She climbed up the rickety spiral staircase, her stiletto heel getting stuck in the holes of the metal treads. She pulled her designer shoe free, then tiptoed the rest of the way. Even though they were at a seedy club, she didn&rsquo;t have to dress trashy. Her tight, leather dress, tailored to perfectly hug her generous curves, probably cost more than most of these people made in a month.</p>

  <p>As she walked over to the gaming loft, the speakers perfectly canceled out the techno thumps, making the song transition into a classy jazz tune. She wove around the digital game tables, holograms of balls clattering around as a man pantomimed a shot with his imaginary pool cue.</p>

  <p>Her sister-in-law, Clara, had no idea how to dress for a girls&rsquo; night out. Her slacks were more fitting for the office and her black blouse made her disappear into the shadows. She sat in a booth at the back corner of the loft, nursing a soft drink and looking bored. If it weren&rsquo;t for her light-colored hair, Annette might not have been able to see her at all.</p>

  <p>Annette shot back the rest of her drink and set the empty glass on the table in front of Clara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attract more attention if we dance together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great on your own,&rdquo; Clara said, giving Annette a thumbs up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Annette pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to score by skulking in the corner.&rdquo; A man sitting in the booth behind Clara turned to see who was talking, and Annette rewarded him with a wink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Clara said. Annette wished she had found someone, anyone, else to come out with her tonight. Even her brother would have been a better wing-man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink,&rdquo; she offered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re speaking my language.&rdquo; The two women went to the drink kiosk at the side of the loft. With two fresh drinks glowing under the flashing lights, Annette led Clara over to the front of the loft and they started dancing next to the railing, the dance floor proper directly below them.</p>

  <p>Annette tried her best to look sexy, swaying her hips in circles and bending to the floor.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Clara turned to dance with her, closing the gap between them so their pelvises touched as they swayed to the music. &ldquo;Ray is going to hear about this,&rdquo; Clara said. Ray was Clara&rsquo;s husband and Annette&rsquo;s brother. &ldquo;Annette, look. That guy&rsquo;s totally checking you out.&rdquo; Clara pointed down to a man on the dance floor wearing a tight button-up shirt with black slacks. He was tall with an athletic physique, black hair, and dark mysterious eyes. He waved and smiled when Annette looked over at him. &ldquo;Go talk to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette knew she wasn&rsquo;t the most attractive woman. Her look for this evening had required tons of effort: a spa treatment to give her pale skin a healthy glow, a trip to the salon to achieve subtle blond highlights, and an appointment with the best makeup artist in Seattle. Apparently it had all been worth the effort.</p>

  <p>Now was not the time to be shy. She carefully navigated back down the stairs and made her way across the dance floor, approaching him. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Annette.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Annette,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beautiful name. Can I buy you a drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One drink led to two. Before she knew it, Annette was dancing the rest of the night away with Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome. As the lights came up at last call, her new companion offered to walk her out.</p>

  <p>They stood on the curb as other partiers bustled by, heading home for the night. &ldquo;You drive here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, my friend dropped me off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How are you getting home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I do live right there,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her as he pointed to the tall building across the street. &ldquo;Would you like to come up? Keep the night going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said, grinning wide. Her only goal at the moment was getting this man alone and undressed.</p>

  <p>He grabbed both of her hands and looked her in the eye. &ldquo;Before we do, I have to be completely honest with you.&rdquo; Annette eagerly nodded. &ldquo;I really want to fuck you, and if you come up to my apartment, I may not be able to stop myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She bit her lip and smiled. Even though he had probably used this line with several other woman, it worked on her. She leaned in and pressed her mouth against his, a hungry kiss to make him want more. They could hardly keep their hands off each other as he led her across the street, into the building, up the elevator, and inside his small apartment.</p>

  <p>As soon as his door was closed behind them, they lost all restraint. She pulled open his shirt, exposing his strong chest and perfect abs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got an implant, I&rsquo;m okay with skipping protection,&rdquo; he said as he peeled off her dress.</p>

  <p>Annette looked at the angry red scar on her upper arm. &ldquo;It got infected, but it still works,&rdquo; she lied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said before pushing her down onto the bed. He unfastened his belt and pulled down his pants. As he climbed on top of her, Annette thought about how lucky she was. The timing was perfect, and she couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a more attractive man to father her future baby.</p>

  <p>Once he was spent and had fallen asleep, she slipped out of his apartment and went home. She had achieved her goal for the night. There was no point staying until morning.</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">A tired-looking woman answered the door to the nice townhouse located in the more affluent area of Seattle. Irene looked down at the file she held to double check the name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Mr. Theodore Mosley. Is he in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doctor. And no, he&rsquo;s at work. I&rsquo;m his wife.&rdquo; The sounds of a child shrieking came from inside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I come in? I&rsquo;d like to ask you a few questions.&rdquo; The chill outside prickled Irene&rsquo;s skin through the loose knit of her sweater, and she could feel the warm air coming from inside the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Mrs. Mosley opened the door and let Irene in. &ldquo;Please excuse the mess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s quite all right,&rdquo; Irene said. There were toys all over the floor in the hall as Mrs. Mosley led the way to the living room. A gate sectioned off a corner of the room, holding back a mountain of toys and sports gear. Each potentially dangerous surface&mdash;the fireplace, coffee table corners, staircase&mdash;was either blocked off or covered with foam padding. There was baby proofing, and then there was this living room.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mosley and Irene took a seat in the living room as the older child threw toys at the wall. Irene sat on the canvas slip-covered couch while Mrs. Mosley settled into a self-gliding chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this your and Dr. Mosley&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; Irene asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she beamed. &ldquo;This is Walter. He&rsquo;s so smart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter was listed in her file. He was low functioning due to a severe mental handicap. Children like him were rare since most parents opted to terminate early on and try again for a healthier baby.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes he is,&rdquo; Irene said, forcing a smile at the child. She knew fawning over people&rsquo;s offspring helped when she needed them to open up. &ldquo;Do you know if your husband has fathered any other children?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has not,&rdquo; Mrs. Mosley said firmly, clearly offended by Irene&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Walter is our one. After he was born, Theodore went through the required sterilization procedure. So did I.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene looked down at her file. Just a month ago, a baby girl had been born and when her DNA was added to the Genome Database, Theodore Mosley was identified as the father.</p>

  <p>Everyone&rsquo;s DNA was sequenced and put on file at birth. To help enforce the progeny laws, which limited each person to having only one child, parents were forced to get sterilized as soon as their first baby was born. The process was extremely effective for both men and women. It was very rare for a man to accidentally, or even intentionally, father a second baby. She just needed a sample from Dr. Mosley to confirm that he was indeed sterile, and then she could close this file.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there a work phone number I could reach your husband at?&rdquo; Irene asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll write it down for you.&rdquo; Mrs. Mosley pulled up the number on her device. &ldquo;He works in emergency medicine, so he isn&rsquo;t always able to answer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; Irene said, pulling out her own device. Just a tap of her device to Mrs. Mosley&rsquo;s transferred the number. &ldquo;Thank you so much for your time.&rdquo; Mrs. Mosley shook Irene&rsquo;s outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>Irene rushed through the cold street back to her car. She made a note on her file to obtain a semen sample from Dr. Mosley. If it came back clean, she could close out the case. With someone like a respected medical doctor, Irene didn&rsquo;t suspect foul play.</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">Annette swirled the end of the little piece of paper in her small cup of urine. &ldquo;Start timer, two minutes,&rdquo; she said. Her device showed a stopwatch which started ticking down seconds. Her excitement kept her from sitting still and she tapped her foot impatiently as she sat perched at the edge of the toilet seat. It had taken all her willpower to wait until she was late before doing a test.</p>

  <p>At thirty-two, she was quickly reaching what her gynecologist called $lsquo;advanced maternal age.&rsquo; With all the trappings of success&mdash;a high paying career, luxury penthouse apartment, celebrity connections, and enviable wardrobe&mdash;the only unfulfilled part of her life was the lack of a child to nurture and love. The current laws dictated that each person was only allowed to have one. She knew having a baby would make it even harder to find a husband, but right now she didn&rsquo;t care. The biological urge to be a mother overruled all reason.</p>

  <p>Her device beeped. The two minutes were up. Annette fed the small piece of paper into the slot at the bottom of her device. She said, &ldquo;Perform pregnancy test,&rdquo; then watched the graphics on the front of her device swirl before a red symbol filled the screen.</p>

  <p>The device read out her results in a computerized voice. &ldquo;Pregnancy confirmed. You are three weeks, six days along. Estimated due date, October twenty-fifth, twenty-fifty-nine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette hugged the device to her chest. It was finally happening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like to schedule an eight week appointment with your gynecologist, Dr. Walker, on Friday, March fourteenth, at eight am?&rdquo; the computerized voice from Annette&rsquo;s device asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes! Add it to my calendar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Appointment with Dr. Walker for Friday, March fourteenth at eight am added to calendar. Notifications set for day before and thirty minutes prior.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette jumped up and danced for joy. This was everything she wanted. She had to tell someone. She&rsquo;d call Irene.</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">Irene pushed through the throng of people in the cafe, making her way to Annette who was standing in line.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God, does everywhere have to be this crowded?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>

  <p>Irene looked back around the dining area. There were tons of people packed in the quaint little cafe talking noisily over their lunches. The dense population in Seattle was a daily reminder of why the progeny laws were so important.</p>

  <p>Although climatologists were never able to convince all of the United States Congress that climate change was already in progress, the damaging effects of fossil fuels could no longer be ignored. Smog stretched far beyond city limits. After several years of consistently poor crop yields, something had to be done.</p>

  <p>But instead of limiting pollution and making stricter emission regulations, the bill that had finally passed which directly addressed the problem introduced the progeny laws. These regulations dictated the number of children people could have and prohibiting certain procreation practices. They had been around since the 2020s. Only in the past twenty years had more extreme measures of sterilization been widely implemented.</p>

  <p>When they reached the counter, Annette waved her device under the scanner. A receipt printed out with a friendly computer voice saying, &ldquo;Please take a seat and a server will bring your order shortly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After some searching, they were able to find a free table. As soon as they sat, a server came out with their food and drinks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two strawberry salads, a coffee, and a decaf cappuccino with extra foam.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Decaf?&rdquo; Irene asked, raising a brow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Annette said slowly, a cheshire grin spreading across her face. She took a small sip from her drink, then wiped off the spot of foam that clung to her nose. &ldquo;I have news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene looked at her expectantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Annette? What the hell? How did you do that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette sat back and frowned. &ldquo;Well, Irene, when a man loves a woman very much, he gives her a special hug&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; Irene said. &ldquo;You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as hard as I thought it would be,&rdquo; she said, stuffing a forkful of salad in her mouth before continuing. &ldquo;I cut out my implant, then earlier this month when I was ovulating, I went to that seedy club you recommended and met a man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was hearing. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have recommended that place if I knew you&rsquo;d go there looking for a hook up. That place is dripping with venereal disease. Did you at least use some form of protection?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette raised her brows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant, so&hellip; no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene grasped her head in her hands. There were better, safer ways for a single woman to conceive.</p>

  <p>Annette let out a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t give me that look. I swear I tried all the proper channels. I signed up for matching services, put out an add for a sperm donor, asked all my single male friends and coworkers for a donation. Hell, I even asked the intern. It got me nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You removed your own implant?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette bit her lip. &ldquo;Look, I set up an appointment to have my doctor do it, but since I didn&rsquo;t have a father lined up, she refused.&rdquo; She took another big bite of salad.</p>

  <p>Irene looked down at her untouched food. She couldn&rsquo;t eat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you have to do genetic counseling before getting pregnant. What if you and your one night stand are both carriers of CF or something like that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette slammed her fork down, speaking through a mouthful of spinach leaves. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just be happy for me? Because I&rsquo;m happy. I want this baby. I made this baby happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene nodded. It was already done. Nothing she said now could change that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you. Congratulations.&rdquo; She picked at her salad with her fork before placing the utensil back on the table. &ldquo;Was it really that difficult to find a donor a more legitimate way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Freaking impossible. Believe me, I did not enjoy digging this thing out myself.&rdquo; Annette rolled up her sleeve to expose her upper arm. Halfway between her shoulder and elbow was an oozing scab centered on a large, inflamed red welt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh my God, Annette. You need to have a doctor look at that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Annette said, rolling back down her sleeve, &ldquo;when I go in to get the first scan of my baby. Believe me, if there were any other way, I would have done that. I had been looking for a baby daddy for over a year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene looked down and sighed. &ldquo;I think Jamie wants a baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, shit. Well, maybe you two will have better luck than I did.&rdquo; Irene didn&rsquo;t look up from her food. &ldquo;Are <i>you</i> ready for a baby?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>

  <p>Irene shook her head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She glanced out the window and saw the first few raindrops fall. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t outright brought it up yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe she won&rsquo;t mention it for a while,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>

  <h1 id="chap02">two</h1>

  <p class="first">There was a pile of files on Irene&rsquo;s desk. The occasional infraction of fathering too many children seemed to be becoming more frequent. She picked up the top folder and opened it. Don Young. He lived in Everette, which was just north of her office. A short drive through the rain might be relaxing.</p>

  <p>Irene stood next to the door where the overhang shielded her from the pouring rain. The generic brown brick building loomed behind her, rain dripping down the sides like each window was crying.</p>

  <p>She reached for her device in the front pocket of her slacks and said, &ldquo;Summon car.&rdquo; Within a minute, her old, silver electric car pulled up and stopped in front of the building. She tucked the file in her waistband. Pulling her coat up over her head in an attempt to keep her curls dry, she dashed through the rain and slipped into the driver's seat of her car. She placed the file in the seat next to her and spoke again into her device. &ldquo;Take me to 617 Park Street, Everette.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The graphics on her device swirled before its computerized voice said, &ldquo;Calculating directions.&rdquo; She held it up to the dash of her car and after a second, the car and her device made a synchronized beep. &ldquo;Traveling to six-one-seven Park Street, Everette.&rdquo; The car merged onto the street and navigated down the road on its own through the driving rain.</p>

  <p>When she arrived at Don&rsquo;s address, she grabbed her file and reached behind her for the umbrella in the back seat. 617 Park Street was a tall apartment complex. She walked quickly from the street side parking spot her car had found to the front entrance of the monolithic building.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; the doorman greeted.</p>

  <p>Irene fought with her umbrella trying to close it. She stomped her feet on the mat to shed any extra water from her shoes before venturing farther into the nice lobby.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello. I&rsquo;m Irene Crow, here to see Don Young in apartment twelve forty-nine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I see your ID?&rdquo; the doorman said.</p>

  <p>Irene gave him her device which displayed her picture and work ID for the Social Department. The doorman scanned the screen before handing it back. &ldquo;The elevator will take you right up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said before breezing past the front desk to the elevator bank. There were no up or down buttons to press since the elevators were completely automated. The doorman was the only access up and cameras at each floor would detect if there was anyone waiting to go down to the lobby.</p>

  <p>Irene stepped into the waiting elevator and the doors glided shut behind her. It swiftly took her to the twelfth floor. As she walked down the hall, her device instructed, &ldquo;Apartment twelve forty-nine is ahead and to the left.&rdquo; She found the correct door and gave a sharp knock.</p>

  <p>For a moment, no one answered. She knocked again. Right when she was about to knock a third time, the door opened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; a groggy middle-aged man asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don Young?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Irene Crow from the Social Department. I just need to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you must.&rdquo; He held the door open to let Irene in.</p>

  <p>The features on his face along with the antiques decorating his apartment indicated his Chinese heritage. Even though the room was dark, she could see a clay soldier on display, along with an elegantly painted fan and framed calligraphy art. In the corner of the living room sat an expensive-looking stringed instrument. Irene opened her file to confirm Don&rsquo;s profession. He was a concert cellist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lights on.&rdquo; With his command, the lights in the room began to glow, their brightness increasing slowly as to not hurt the eyes. The living room behind them could have been a museum of Chinese culture. &ldquo;I apologize, I&rsquo;m somewhat of a night owl.&rdquo; He wore a terry robe and looked tired like he had just gotten out of bed. &ldquo;My current concert series at the Seattle Theater has me on kind of a late schedule.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene should have recognized his name: D. Young. She had one of his albums of cello solos on her device.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for having me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I only have a few questions for you and then I can get out of your hair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, settling into a black leather recliner in the living room. &ldquo;Ask away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you have any children, Mr. Young?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My second wife wanted to have a baby. We had a little boy, Jia. When we divorced, she took him with her back to China.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked down at her file. Jia would be a teenager right now. &ldquo;Jia is your only child that you&rsquo;re aware of?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Don sighed. &ldquo;I always wanted to be a dad, but my ex took that away from me when she took my son. I had the&hellip; the procedure done the day after we found out we, my ex and I, were having a boy.&rdquo; He looked up at Irene, his eyes weary. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t aware of fathering a child with a Miss&hellip;&rdquo; she shuffled through the file briefly, &ldquo;Linda Summers in San Francisco last spring?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Don shrugged. &ldquo;I perform all over the world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had women proposition me in several cities. Sometimes I use protection. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t. But I had the procedure done, so I&rsquo;m not trying to sow my seed or break any laws.&rdquo; In her file, she also had a copy of his certificate of sterilization, a document which was public record.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I get a sample?&rdquo; Irene asked. This part was always awkward and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that really necessary?&rdquo; he asked flatly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it comes back with no viable sperm, then I can close my investigation and we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Irene pulled a sterile collection cup from her bag and handed it to Don. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here.&rdquo; Don frowned, but dutifully disappeared to the bathroom to fill the cup.</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">Jamie was past the point of disappointed. Irene never remembered important dates, holidays, or birthdays. Why should she expect today to be any different? She sighed as she shoved another chocolate candy into her mouth and bit down into the soft center. A quick glance at the clock confirmed it was late, past 11. There was nothing interesting on the evening news tonight. She should just go to bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Screen off,&rdquo; she said as she tossed the half-eaten box of chocolates onto the sofa. The room was dark except for the soft flicker of candlelight. She went over to the dining table and blew out the two long, tapered candles which had already burned down to short stubs. Irene&rsquo;s favorite take-out hamburger sat untouched on her plate, a card with a kitten saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re purrr-fect!&rdquo; tucked underneath. Jamie took the card and tossed it into the trash on her way to the bedroom.</p>

  <p>She slipped off her silky robe and hung it back in the closet. Next, she removed her lacy panties and bra. She breathed a sigh of relief, finally free from the itchy lingerie. She put on a pair of comfy cotton briefs and a tank top to sleep in.</p>

  <p>The room felt cold and stuffy. The rain outside wasn&rsquo;t coming down as hard now, so she opened the window to let some fresh air in. A damp cool breeze rushed into the room. Jamie smiled. Irene liked to sleep in a warm bedroom. She did not.</p>

  <p>She curled up under the comforter and tried to get some rest. She willed sleep to come, but it never did.</p>

  <p>The front door made a high creaking sound as it slowly opened. Shuffling noises came from the living room, followed by a whispered, &ldquo;Damnit,&rdquo; undoubtedly Irene realizing she forgot what day it was.</p>

  <p>Jamie held back tears as she listened to Irene quietly change into a sleep shirt before slipping into bed next to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to say anything?&rdquo; Jamie asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were already asleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too pissed to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry I forgot our anniversary,&rdquo; Irene said as she tried to hug her.</p>

  <p>Jamie pulled away and sat up at the edge of the bed. Her long black hair formed a curtain over her back. &ldquo;I just kind of expect you to forget these things. I&rsquo;m used to it now. Your work has always come first. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought this time would be any different.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, Jamie. I&rsquo;m sorry. You know how much I care about you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jamie shook her head. &ldquo;You have a funny way of showing it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned to look at Irene. Her brown eyes glistened. &ldquo;Am I just not important to you anymore?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene slid across the bed and hugged her wife from behind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most important thing.&rdquo; She tucked Jamie&rsquo;s hair around her shoulder and kissed the base of her neck. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jamie pulled away, tears slipping from her eyes down her cheeks. &ldquo;Do you? Do you really?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do. I wish there was some way to prove it to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jamie sat for a moment and remained silent, before saying, &ldquo;I want to have a baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When they had first started dating, she made it no secret that she wanted to have a kid. Even though Irene wasn&rsquo;t fond of children, she seemed amenable to the idea of having a baby one day. Now in her mid twenties, Jamie was the perfect age to have a healthy pregnancy. If Irene truly loved her like she said, she&rsquo;d agree to raising a child together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, now,&rdquo; Jamie said in a huff. She wiped the tears from her face and turned away. She knew she was manipulating the situation to get what she wanted, but it was so hard to get Irene to talk about starting a family. &ldquo;Maybe a baby would love me back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Irene sighed. &ldquo;You really think a baby would make you happy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jamie nodded vigorously, turning to face Irene.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; Irene conceded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a baby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jamie smiled and kissed her. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She rolled back around to try to get to sleep. &ldquo;Who should we ask to father our baby?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go to sleep,&rdquo; Irene said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about that hispanic guy you work with? Arnold?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Angel. And no. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">It was late, so the Social Department offices were quiet. Irene&rsquo;s desk was amongst what they called the pen, the communal area where the desks dotted the floor with no barriers, walls, or dividers between them. The layout was supposed to encourage an air of teamwork, but right now, all Irene wanted was privacy. She flipped through the file one more time. This was a cold case. There were no new leads, so the file stayed in the cabinet collecting dust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing with that?&rdquo; Angel asked.</p>

  <p>Irene jumped. She didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know she was looking at this particular file. Angel leaned against her desk, picking up her pen. He twirled it around his finger while casually examining the file she held with his brown eyes. Even though he was impeccably groomed, his black hair gelled in place and his beard meticulously trimmed, he wore sloppy clothes. Today, he had on an oversized gray t-shirt and ratty canvas pants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just, uh&hellip;&rdquo; she closed the file quickly before stuffing it in the bottom drawer of her desk. &ldquo;I was just checking to see if the original case workers missed anything. They didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Angel said, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m checking out for the night. Have a good weekend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She watched him disappear around the corner before fishing the file back out of her desk. This case was useless. A law student had been selling sperm, an act which in itself was illegal. They found a promotion for his &lsquo;first class genetics&rsquo; in a student newspaper, and one of the social workers responded to the ad in an attempt to shut his operation down.</p>

  <p>He had been careful not to do any of the sales transactions in person, instead mailing his product to hopeful customers. The sample the Social Department obtained had been frozen, and not carefully. Their lab had been unable to sequence the DNA in the sample, which meant it would also do nothing to help make a baby. In the end, his little business had been a low priority, and with no leads, it got filed away and forgotten.</p>

  <p>In a moment of weakness, Irene thought maybe she could find this man and get a fresh sample. Even if his business plan wasn&rsquo;t well thought out, he still successfully got into law school. He wouldn&rsquo;t make the worst father.</p>

  <p>She closed the file and brought it back to the cabinet of closed cases. It made a thud as it fell on top of the pile of other neglected case files.</p>

  <div class="sb">&middot;&middot;OOO&middot;&middot;</div>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Would you like something to drink, sweetheart?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just some water, please,&rdquo; Annette said. She was the first to arrive at her parent&rsquo;s apartment for their annual Easter dinner. It was so typical for Ray and Clara to be late.</p>

  <p>Annette sat back in the old tattered sofa, the same sofa that had been in this living room since she could remember. When she was little, their home had been sparsely decorated. But her mother, Gerry, had a new hobby: needlepoint. Little pillows with yarn depictions of kittens, puppies, flowers, and fruit bowls seemed to multiply with each visit. Pulling a lump out from behind her, Annette found the newest addition, a grid of four sheep on four differently colored backgrounds. She smirked at the silly pillow and set it on the seat next to her.</p>

  <p>Tom returned with a glass of water for Annette. Even though he was retired, he still wore dress slacks, a button up shirt, and a sweater vest every day. &ldquo;Thank you, Dad,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>There was a knock on the door, followed by Gerry yelling, &ldquo;Tom, get the door,&rdquo; from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Raymond. Clara. So good to see you two,&rdquo; Tom opened the door wide to let them in. He gave them both a hug as they shuffled inside the spacious apartment. &ldquo;Can I get you two anything to drink?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a beer,&rdquo; Ray said. Annette&rsquo;s brother had the same brown hair and hazel eyes as her, but their matching square jaws and thick eyebrows looked better on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No alcohol for me.&rdquo; Clara bit her lip. She flashed a quick smile at Ray before telling Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some mineral water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tom laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not that fancy here. How &lsquo;bout some water from the tap?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, tap water has too much fluoride. It isn&rsquo;t good for the&hellip; me.&rdquo; Clara now had an stupid smile on her face and when she glanced at Ray, he gave her a smirk back. They were both grinning like idiots. Something was up.</p>

  <p>Tom came back from the kitchen with a beer for Ray. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got orange juice and milk. I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Milk, please,&rdquo; Clara said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take a seat, honey,&rdquo; Ray said, indicating Tom&rsquo;s favorite recliner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Clara said. Annette knew it would be polite to get up and give her brother and sister-in-law a welcome hug, but she was too tired to bother. She had been overly fatigued the last couple of months. Just staying awake for a full day of work at the office was a chore.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to strain yourself,&rdquo; he said. He held out his hand and led her to the chair like she was incapable of sitting down by herself. There was that stupid grin again as she complied to his request.</p>

  <p>With the strict progeny laws, siblings were incredibly rare. Annette and Ray were twins. Multiples got a pass in the one child restriction, but medications which encouraged multiple births were prohibited. Women who sought fertility treatments were often disappointed at how little doctors could do to help.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all can come take a seat at the table. Dinner&rsquo;s almost ready,&rdquo; Gerry called from the kitchen. Tom and Ray set the table as Clara and Annette took their usual seats.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It smells delicious, Mom,&rdquo; Annette said as Gerry set down the platter with her usual cooked-to-death roast and soggy vegetables.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sweetie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Everyone helped themselves, and Ray filled Clara&rsquo;s plate before putting some on his own.</p>

  <p>Clara lifted her fork, but didn&rsquo;t take a bite. &ldquo;This meat is fully cooked, right? I can&rsquo;t eat any rare meat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gerry always pulls her roast out of the oven a second before it turns into a charcoal biscuit,&rdquo; Tom said with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Gerry frowned. Annette looked a lot like her mother and knew one day she would age just like her, with generous amounts of gray in her hair and droopy features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe we should just tell them,&rdquo; Clara said to Ray, rubbing her palms together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; He reached over to give her hand a squeeze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell us what?&rdquo; Annette asked, her mouth full of food.</p>

  <p>Clara nodded at Ray before saying excitedly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pregnant!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette did her best not to choke on the roast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh Clara, that&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; Gerry said as she jumped up from her chair and smothered Clara with a hug. Tom gave his son a knowing smile before shaking his hand and slapping him on the back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I just couldn&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; Clara said. &ldquo;I only found out a couple days ago. My first OB appointment isn&rsquo;t for a month.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re already telling everyone?&rdquo; Annette asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Clara said. &ldquo;But you guys are family. I&rsquo;m so excited I could burst. I had to share with someone.&rdquo; Ray gave his wife another goofy grin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you two made my day,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;When is the baby due?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;December,&rdquo; Ray answered. Tears came to the corners of Clara&rsquo;s eyes as Ray turned to give her a hug.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, my first grand-baby,&rdquo; Gerry said. &ldquo;This is the best gift you could ever get me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Annette said, putting down her fork, &ldquo;your first grandchild is due in October. I&rsquo;m pregnant. I&rsquo;m already three months along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette&rsquo;s announcement was met with shocked faces and stunned silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How could you do this to me?&rdquo; Clara asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not <span style="font-style: italic;">doing</span> anything to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her astonishment quickly changed to red faced rage. &ldquo;You knew we were trying to have a baby. You just had to take this away from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take this away from you?&rdquo; Annette spat. &ldquo;You were there with me at the club the night my baby was conceived.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would actually work,&rdquo; Clara yelled. Ray started rubbing his wife&rsquo;s back trying to get her to calm down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait. You&rsquo;re pregnant from a one night stand?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>

  <p>Annette&rsquo;s silence answered the question for them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sweetie, you&rsquo;re ruined,&rdquo; Gerry said. &ldquo;No man is going to want you if your oven&rsquo;s already closed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annette pulled her napkin from her lap and threw it onto the table. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you guys be happy for me? You were all so thrilled when Clara said she&rsquo;s all of two days pregnant.&rdquo; Ray held his arms around his wife as she sobbed at the dinner table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Their situation is different,&rdquo; Tom said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re married and ready to bring a child into this world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want this baby,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I planned on getting pregnant. I have a great job and more than enough money to support a kid. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so I figured, why keep waiting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Tom leaned forward, pointing an accusatory finger at her. &ldquo;That impulsive attitude is exactly why you&rsquo;re not ready to be a mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s too late now. It&rsquo;s done. You&rsquo;re getting your first grandchild from me in October. So, you all can suck it.&rdquo; Annette got up from her chair and stormed out of the dining room and into the living room. This was not how she had imagined breaking the wonderful news of her upcoming baby with her family. She grabbed her jacket from the hook next to the door and pulled it on before leaving the apartment.</p>
